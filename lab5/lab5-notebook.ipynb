    "\n",
    "* Choose the starting points in the most homogeneous areas possible.\n",
    "* Compute the standard deviation of each of the dimensions of color space for a colored image or just in one dimension if grayscale image.\n",
    "* Recursively divide the quarter until the created quarters are big enough.\n",
    "* Choose the center of the biggest blocks as the starting points.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 2: Growth of the regions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Enlarge a region by agglomerating neighboring pixels.\n",
    "* Choose pixels that maintain the homogeneity of the region.\n",
    "* Define a homogeneity indicator.\n",
    "* Add neighboring pixels to the region if the homogeneity indicator remains true.\n",
    "* Stop the growth when no more pixels can be added without breaking the homogeneity."
